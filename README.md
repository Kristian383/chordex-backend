# backend_chordex

As a guitarist in my free time, i've come with an idea of making an web app named [ChordEx](https://chordex.net/) which is imagined to be a virtual songbook where you can write your own information about songs that you learn or make.

This repository shows backend code <br>
Frontend is visible here: https://github.com/Kristian383/chordex-master
